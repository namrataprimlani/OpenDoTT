<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;The fridge can capture video and audio data via its inbuilt camera and microphone. </b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;The smart fridge has face recognition technology that allows it to identify who is using the fridge. </b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;The fridge can store the data it captures such as audio clips, video recordings, grocery records, food habit records and personal food habits linked to a person&rsquo;s face profile. </b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;The fridge provides the options to store the captured personal data either in the cloud or locally on the device. </b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;There is the option to share personal data from the fridge either with the manufacturer of the fridge , with third-party advertisers or with the government. </b></p>

<p dir="ltr"><b>&gt;Finally, the fridge provides the option to turn on or off advertisements based on a user profile it creates of you based on your personal data.&nbsp;</b></p>
&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-5456c30d-7fff-8a61-caba-d7b7399e1061">On the right side of the web app are Data Gate icons. These icons can be dragged to control the features provided by the fridge. The features can be personalised based on individual preferences by asking questions such as - Do I trust the manufacturer of the device with audio clips of my voice? Do I trust the government to know my food habits? Who has access to my data when it is stored in the cloud? Are advertisers tracking what I eat? </b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:28px;">Drag and drop the white circular icons onto the fridge to trigger data gate interactions.</span></p>
