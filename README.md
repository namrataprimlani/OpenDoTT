This is one of the topics under Open Design of Trusted Things (OpenDoTT, opendott.org ), a joint PhD programme between Northumbria University and Mozilla. This folder contains data collected from the research phase 2 - Data Gates: Designing for Trust in the Internet of Things as part of WP2 - D2.1 Technology Demonstrators
# Aim
----------
A Data Gate is a fictional technology that allows people to control information flows in the IoT. Data Gates are electronic tags that are imagined to come in numerous form factors such as badges, wall plaques, stickers, labels or any other compact form. These tags can be programmed to control the flow of information in IoT devices based on rules written into the tag. For example, from a Data Gate sticker placed on a doorway to a room might instruct all IoT devices entering the room to to turn off video recording functions. Parents might place such a sticker in a child’s room or in a playground to prevent surreptitious surveillance of their child.
This project explores the trust in the IoT by allowing people to actively control privacy and consent in IoT devices using a prototype of the Data Gates concept. The aim of this study is to gather qualitative data from participants based on participant's experience of a working prototype of the Data Gates concept and scenarios that explore contexts of use of the Data Gates.
